Learning iOS and Swift for fun and profit!

This repository contains a sample app created by Andy VanWagoner while walking through
[Jameson Quave](https://twitter.com/jquave)'s [Swift tutorial](http://jamesonquave.com).
You can reference his source code on [his github repo](https://github.com/jquave/Swift-Tutorial).

This app also contains a reference analytics implementation of the
[Adobe Marketing Cloud SDK](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/digital-marketing/mobile-services/app-sdk.html),
since I work on the team that develops that SDK, and the
[Mobile Services UI](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/digital-marketing/mobile-services.html).
